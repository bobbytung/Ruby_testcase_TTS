This repository provides materials for APL meeting for JLREQ in Kyoto, 9/8/2019.

I'd like to arise several accessibility issues in East-Asia text layout such as vertical writing and ruby text. We could extend the discussion on W3C TPAC Fukuoka as an unconferenced day topic.

## Ruby text with screen reader.

[This page](https://bobbytung.github.io/Ruby_testcase_TTS/) lists three usage of ruby text:

1, for spelling/pronunciation.
2, for another language (and Katakana).
3, for different meaning.

## Page progress direction with screen reader.
